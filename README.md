# SVGtoTopoJson

A simple SVG to TopoJson converter.

TopoJson is an json file that encodes topology and can be used with Shape Map visual on Power BI.

With SVGtoTopoJson.pbix file is possible to convert any* SVG image to TopoJson file. Why I made it on Power BI? Just to don't have the need to download another tool for use the output on Power BI.

* Only supports SVG files exported from figma.com, and only follow SVG tags: rect, circle, ellipse, path (M, L, H, V, C)
